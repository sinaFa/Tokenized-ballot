# Sample Hardhat Project

This project implements ERC20 and ERC721 using the Open Zappling library. Moreover, we implement typescripts tests and create a scenario of ERC20 and ERC721 token transfer (as well as minting and burning) to use those libraries.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
